The SmartStock Inventory Management System is designed to automate and streamline the stock monitoring process of small grocery stores. 
The project aims to address the inefficiencies of manual record-keeping by providing a digital system that manages products, tracks stock levels, and generates reports using Python, Mysqlite3 , and Tkinter. 
The system enables real-time updates, reduces human errors, and supports better decision-making for store owners. 
This application demonstrates how an affordable and user-friendly software solution can significantly enhance productivity in small and medium-sized businesses.
